Additions to the project

1.  When user clicks "Add New Comment" on the Comment History page, make a small form appear on that page to enter new Comment, instead of redirecting to a New Comment form

2.  Show all existing Subjects on front-page map
    -  Popups will contain Description, Date, Contact, and link to full Subject page.
    -  Tooltips will show the Contact name, and possibly the summary on a second line

3.  Work on the List templates
    -  Style them all alike
    -  Create links to individual item detail pages within each list

4.  Figure out how to upload files on the New Comment page
    -  Add a thumbnail of that image/file to the comment's text message box in the Comment History stream

5.  Create a way to Add New Event from the main map

6.  Add widgets to the Leaflet maps
    -  Basemap toggle
    -  Turn layers on/off (design layers, parcels, etc.)

7.  When a user with Admin rights logs in, show a link to the Admin page in the top-right, next to Logout

8.  Make a little icon appear in the title bar of each Comment window in the History, to indicate the method of contact (email, phone, etc )

9.  Can each View remember its state?  If you switch from main map to Subjects, then back to main map, can it preserve its extent and options?

10. Add a "Home" button to the main map.

11. Remove some of the Leaflet.Draw tools from the Add New Subject tools

12.  In the main map popups:
    - create a way to show how the initial contact came in
    - Method, direction, employee
